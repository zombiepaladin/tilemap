    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This tilemap example utilizes several advanced features</p>
    <h2>Tiled Map Editor</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled Map Editor</a> is one of the most
      popular open-source tile map editors available today.  It was used to create the
      tilemap used in this example, which is saved in the tilemaps directory as
      <a href="tilemaps/example_tilemap.tmx">example_tilemap.tmx</a>.  Tiled's native
      file format, TMX, is a custom XML extension, and as such is both human-readable
      and easily parsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tiled also supports exporting tilemaps as
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON">
        JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
      </a>, which is a very popular serilization format and is almost identical to
      native JavaScript object declarations.  You can see the exported JSON file here:
      <a href="tilemaps/example_tilemap.json">example_tilemap.json</a>.  Compare it with
      the TMX version.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we could request and parse JSON directly from the server, because we are
      running this example from the file system, we will convert the JSON tilemap into
      a JavaScript object declaration.  We simply add an assignment:
      <code> module.exports = </code>
      to the beginning of the JSON file and resave the file with the .js extension.
      You can view the resulting JavaScript file here:
      <a href="tilemaps/example_tilemap.js">example_tilemap.js</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Browserify</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://browserify.org">Browserify</a> is a tool for using Node's
      package manager to bundle JavaScript files into a single bundle to be
      included in a website. In this example, that bundle is
      <a href="./bundle.js">bundle.js</a> and is build from several individual files:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="src/game.js">src/game.js</a> is the primary JavaScript file for the game</a></li>
        <li><a href="src/tilemap.js">src/tilemap.js</a> is the tilemap engine module</li>
        <li><a href="src/game.js">tilemaps/example_tilemap.js</a> contains a single tilemap's data</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that both tilemap.js and example_tilemap.js use the module pattern, setting
      <code>module.exports</code> to a value.  In the case of tilemap.js, it is the Tilemap
      library module.  For example_tilemap.js, it is the JavaScript object representing our
      tilemap data.  We require both of these files in game.js, with the lines:<br>
      <code>
        var tilemap = require('./tilemap.js');<br>
        var tilemapData = require('../tilemaps/example_tilemap.js');<br>
      </code>
      The require function lets Browserify know that we want the contents of these
      files to be pulled into this file, and stored as the variables <code>tilemap</code>
      and <code>tilemapData</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can ask Browserify to build a single JavaScript file from our source code with the command:
      <code class="terminal">
        > browserify src/game.js > bundle.js
      </code>
      This tells browserify to process game.js.  When it encounters the require functions, it
      opens and processes those files, injecting their contents into the JavaScript file it
      is building, <a href="bundle.js">bundle.js</a>, which we can then include as the only
      JavaScript file in our <a href="index.html">index.html</a> file. By packaging our code
      into a single file, we ensure that everything is loaded in the correct order and in a
      single file, while still keeping our development code in multiple files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, Browserify lets us utilize Node packages in our browser JavaScript code
      (provided we don't use any server-only functions, like file I/O).  You can also use
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/watchify">Watchify</a> to automatically
      bundle your changes as you make them.
